<fieldset> <i><small><small><font color= "#00008B">I chose two research methods: survey and interview. In order to identify the effectiveness of the implementation of the parental education program in Kazakhstan and to point out the issues in children raising in Kazakhstan, I made a survey consisting of questions that open these two aims and collect data from different perspectives by gender and age.  Survey research helped me to take answers to my questions from an unlimited number of people. By using a survey I was able to get people’s responses to my questions about the topic in a short period of time. One of the disadvantages of taking a survey is that I needed to do a lot of calculations in order to analyze and compare the collected data. The benefit of the survey from the interview is that people respond as honestly as possible because they answered anonymously. The interview also includes the idea of uncovering the aims of the project. Interview questions reveal 4 main aims of the research like  defining the term “parental education”, analyzing the effectiveness of the implementation of education for parents, pointing out the issues in the upbringing of children in Kazakhstan, and give recommendations on increasing parents’ knowledge of child development and treatment. The interview has several advantages just like, personal interaction, justifying the respondent’s opinion and giving more details. However, the interview is time-consuming, and questions for the interview should be well chosen because it will affect the quality of response. In order to understand the topic before starting the research, I made a literature review on past studies as a result of which I defined the term “parent education” just like I understand it and select objectives for my research question.

    <fieldset> <i><small><small><font color= "#00008B"><b>Aims:</b>
As described in the context part of the research, the way major fashion trends
(clothing, colors, looks) are established is not completely fixed, meaning it can vary
depending on a number of factors, such as region, psychology, media etc. It’s interesting to
know a pattern between creation of piece of clothing and its consequential popularity, which
is why the first aim of this research is identifying what or who contributes/impacts
establishment of a fashion trend.
Since one of the main properties a trend must have is its appearance in wide spectrum
of regions and different parts of the world, discovering how they become so widespread is of
great importance to understand its nature and what drives it. Based on my personal
experience, observing piece of clothing turn into a trend is extremely difficult because
fashion is rather abstract concept that reflects different aspects of human life than a
compilation of styles and images, what makes it hard to track its way from the source to the
public admiration. Therefore, second aim of the research work is determining what are the
steps required for a fashion trend to reach end clients.
Following two main aims presented above, it becomes essential to combine all the
gathered data in order to see if there is a logical connection between them and remaining
factors (age, personal preference, region) described in details in the literature review. That’s
why the final aim is understanding why people are so affected by fashion trends.

  <b>Conclusion:</b>
  At first sight, it may seem like there is nothing to understand or reveal about fashion
  trends, but in a broader view, it is a complex subject, regarding several processes in society,
  human psychology and many other factors. I had to change my prior opinion about their role
  as a source of inspiration, inclining more to the idea of approval. As a matter of fact, the
  concept of what is appropriate, stylish and fashionable is created by people who have any
  kind of authority or ability to influence, but becomes an entire movement only with the help
  of public, meaning that the main driving force behind trends is audience. Whenever a new
  idea appears online or on TV or a celebrity shows up wearing new outfit, people accept it as
  their tool to obtain the same status or to prove their affiliation to a particular group of other
  people. Trends are important in a way that they allow an individual to draw an image of
  him/her in the eyes of others and be accepted among them. Even if a person is rather practical
  concerning the style, he/she will still be aware of what is trendy. Garment shop owners,
  realizing significant impact of people on the internet, try to conform to the public necessity
  and order clothes after clear research and analysis. Today fashion and trendy clothes are not
  deemed appropriate for women only, when it comes to the way you look, both males and
  females can be extremely thorough. Such phenomenon as fashion trend is not likely to lose its
  power to impact and spread, and with its exceptional capacity to express complexity of
  human nature and way of perceiving information, will always be inherent part of our society.

    <b>Evaluation(300-400 words):</b>
There are certain parts of research that still need to be improved in order for it to be called perfect, but, overall, research shed light on the topic of fashion and trends, providing new ideas and concepts. Including numerous factors when conducting a survey can be considered one of the strongest sides of this research, as it allowed to draw conclusions carefully, taking into account all the possible impacts (gender, age, style, source). Respondents had a variety of options to choose from, so the received answers would be as close to the truth as possible. On the other hand, there is a visible misbalance in respondents’ gender because those who answered were mainly female, what can affect results of the research severely. Although all the answers were thoroughly examined, this aspect should be taken into account when regarding quality of the research and for further improvement. The methods (survey, interview) made it possible to acquire valuable information from representatives of different groups: clothes store owners, consumers. The interview, in particular, helped to understand a process of stocking the market and consumer needs, giving the research a new perspective. The number of respondents (45) matched my expectations, and was enough to receive quality raw data to work with and analyze. Still, to make the results more concise methods part should be altered by including one more method – experiment. Since fashion is a very common and widely known topic online and on social media, running an experiment, observing how people react to certain trends, would be not only possible, but also highly informative. At last, it should be noted that the sources or literature used when writing this work were credible, trustworthy and taken from special websites providing researches on different topics. They helped to form the primary idea of how fashion industry and trends work, and provided aspects and concepts I haven’t considered before, what definitely enhanced quality of the research.

    <b>Further reseach(200-300 words):</b>
    After conducting the study, I had another question. Education for parents includes raising the
    knowledge, experience and activity of two parents in the life of the child. Today a stereotype has been
    founded in society that children receive upbringing and care from their mother, and their father
    provides them financially. Fathers spend less time with children. The participation of both parents is
    very important in the development of the child. Both partners should receive parental education,
    which means they are both responsible for the upbringing. If only mothers receive knowledge and
    experience, and the father of the family remains on the sidelines, this will negatively affect the
    upbringing of the child. This also applies to the fact that special organizations consider the number of
    underage girls who have become mothers, but there are no statistics on young fathers. These two
    statistics are not always equal. Fathers and mothers should be equally important in the life and
    upbringing of the child. I would like to start a new study in order to find out the role of fathers in the
    Kazakh society, namely how much time they spend with children and their participation in raising a
    child. I need to know especially fathers opinion of getting parent education in order to increase the
    effectiveness of implementation education for parents in Kazakhstan.
