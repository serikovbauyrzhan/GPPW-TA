<p> - What is the purpose of your research and what are the specific aims? </p>
<p> - What are you planning to achieve? </p>
<p> - What methods did you choose and why did you choose them?</p>
<p> - How valid and reliable is your research data? Think about population/sample and triangulation</p>
<p> - Read this example (students average work(not ideal) from last year):</p>
<fieldset> <i><small><small><font color= "#00008B">I chose two research methods: survey and interview. In order to identify the effectiveness of the implementation of the parental education program in Kazakhstan and to point out the issues in children raising in Kazakhstan, I made a survey consisting of questions that open these two aims and collect data from different perspectives by gender and age.  Survey research helped me to take answers to my questions from an unlimited number of people. By using a survey I was able to get people’s responses to my questions about the topic in a short period of time. One of the disadvantages of taking a survey is that I needed to do a lot of calculations in order to analyze and compare the collected data. The benefit of the survey from the interview is that people respond as honestly as possible because they answered anonymously. The interview also includes the idea of uncovering the aims of the project. Interview questions reveal 4 main aims of the research like  defining the term “parental education”, analyzing the effectiveness of the implementation of education for parents, pointing out the issues in the upbringing of children in Kazakhstan, and give recommendations on increasing parents’ knowledge of child development and treatment. The interview has several advantages just like, personal interaction, justifying the respondent’s opinion and giving more details. However, the interview is time-consuming, and questions for the interview should be well chosen because it will affect the quality of response. In order to understand the topic before starting the research, I made a literature review on past studies as a result of which I defined the term “parent education” just like I understand it and select objectives for my research question.
